### Notes for Students and Instructors

- The most challenging topics for students have been 1) GitHub and 2) Unit Testing  
These practices will help: 
  - realizing that if you find these hard, it's expected. Conversely, the other topics might be easier!
  - devote adequate time to review notes and practice
  - work with classmates, the TA and the instructor

- Class time should consist of a lot of hands-on coding
- Most of the coding is in Python and learning conceptual ideas (functions, classes, etc.)
- With Python and conceptual ideas under your belt, learning R will be easier
- Students enjoy the group project
- Reminder that each student writes their own code in lab assignments
